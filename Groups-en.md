# UIC Homebrew Computer Club Groups Plan

UIC Homebrew Computer Club (Abbreviation: UICHCC) is (currently) a non-student-association interest-driven organization. Its mode of operation is similar to TEDxUIC; that is, the club's internal members are responsible for maintaining the operation of the club and participating in project development, however **all the creative production of UICHCC will be opened to the public**.

The club is organized as (a relatively losen form like) star topology, that is, setting up a central group (Main Root Group), while project groups (unlimited in number), which are managed by the central group, are set under it. Unlike the concept of "department", these groups can be added, or revoked, not even affecting the club's normal work. Members of a specific group are not restricted to that group; that is, groups are used only for management and publicity, **everyone can, at their will, participate in all project groups in the club (except: the group has extra regulations, the infrastructures and services maintained by the club).**
  - Practically, under the Main Root Group, there are several groups which are maintaining the club itself; although these groups are at the same level of other project groups, revoking or changing these groups needs to be unanimously adopted by the Main Root Group. See also the regulations on operation of the Main Root Group.

Note: The Open Source Community has a higher independence within UICHCC. But It still belongs to the UICHCC. It has its own public relationship, and can decide its own affair without the consent of the Main Root Group. However, when advertising the open source community, UICHCC should be advertised at the same time.
