# Proposal - UIC HCC Computer Society

Dear Sir / Madam:



We are computer technology enthusiasts in UIC from different majors and different grades, who founded UIC HCC Computer Society (Unofficial) in October, 2016, in hope of spreading the knowledge of computer science and technology, conveying the sprit of open source, and sharing as well as focusing on the frontier development of computer science. Today, we hope to establish UIC HCC Computer Society officially attaching to Innovation Center, which will be put in services soon since the UIC new campus have been moved smoothly. We hope to make contributions to students and staffs in UIC as well as the Industry-University-Research Integration plan of UIC with the support of this platform.

This proposal will introduce the overview, vision, missions, tasks and expected achievements of UIC HCC Computer Society (hereafter abbreviated as the Society). Simutaneously, we will list our expectations to Innovation Center and UIC.



## Overview of the Society

The Society is established unofficially in October, 2016, and have 20 members from different majors and different grades (members list in appendix). We make our goal **Bridging You And Technology** as our responsibility, and spread knowledge related to computer science to UIC teachers and students in different occasions actively. With the emerge of new technologies in computer science, we find it difficult to achieve our goal and keep our development under the unofficial operation mode. Therefore, the Society wish to obtain the strong support from UIC and Innovation Center to carry out more science-popularising lectures, practices, and research activities.

Currently, we have our public website, GitHub Organization, mail system and WeChat official account.



## Vision of the Society

In order to implement a fulfilling practice on the fundamental goal of the Society, **Bridging You And Technology**, the Society hopes to carry out **popularization of knowledge related to computer science**, **software and hardware development** cooperated with our college or the Society organizations, **participation in open source projects** and **research on frontier theories of computer science and their application**.

### Popularizing knowledge related to computer science

Though computer has gone into our life, for most people, computer is still a "black-box". Meanwhile, many concepts of computer science such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are very popular. New products and concepts in computer science field emerge one after the other. Many people are interested in these "high technology" products and concepts.

Most of the members in the Society have some experience and knowledge in computer science field, and they are eager to share their knowledge and experience to others. We refer to the operation mode of CUHK(SZ) _Computer @ Comity_ and make popularization of computer science knowledge as our long term goal as well as a service and welfare provided for all UIC teachers and students.

The scopes of popularize including but not limited to daily usage of computer, skills of using UIC IT system, introductions of programming languages, data analysis and Artificial Intelligence. These activities will be implemented in the forms including but not limited to offline lectures, workshop, sharing discussion, WeChat official account push and online interactive learning.

We hope to respond to our mission through popularize of computer science knowledge, and promote the popularization of knowledge related to IT and computer in UIC to let listeners know more about current trend of computer science and IT industry. At the same time, we can broad the scope of both sides of sharing by these activities.

### Cooperation on software and hardware development

We have found that many people have great ideas. However, they do not know how to achieve their ideas. When an idea stopped at the stage of inspiration, then it is impossible to fulfill its value. The Society hopes to help with achieving the ideas that emerge in UIC with the incubation mechanism of the Innovation Center.

We sincerely hope that we can build up a bridge connecting ideas and achievements with the running mode of Innovation Center.  We will accept ideas from inside and outside the Society, build up a regulation to evaluate, and work on some projects according to our evaluation.

Moreover, we also hope to seize this opportunity to cooperate with other companies and organizations outside college. We convince that we can connect with the IT industry in these cooperation to strengthen our ability and popularize the newest trend of the IT industry.

### Participation of open source projects

We are in a world of open source, and we are working rely on open source software almost every day. The spirit and the value of open source are influencing the whole IT industry. We are responsible to make contributions to open source communities. These including but not limited to localization (translation) of softwares, code submissions, and the creation of open source softwares. We expect that our participation can push the popularization and development of open source culture in UIC as well as the spread of the value of sharing in UIC.

### Research on frontier theories of computer science and their application

Computer Science and IT industry is always under rapid development. It is necessary for us to follow the cutting edge of academic and industry of IT. The reason why we do it is that we can make some contributions on scientific researches of UIC and provide resources for knowledge popularization.

We hope to cooperate with UIC Innovation Center and divisions, majors, and let our members participate in research projects conducted by the Innovation Center and other organizations. The topics and contents of the research should not have any limitation either.

## Our expectations

The above content of this proposal is all what we expect to do in the near future. To achieve these goals, supports from both the college administrations and Innovation Center are indispensible. Therefore, we hope to request the following supports from college administrations and Innovation Center (Sorted by importance):

* **Identity of student organization:** We are still an unofficial student organization until now. To arrange activities in our campus, an official identity is necessary. We hope to obtain an official student organization identity that can be admitted by the college's adminitration.
* **Support of administrative:** If we can obtain an official student organization identity, we hope to obtain corresponding support from administrative departments, including reasonable budgets on activities, a channel for promotion, and recruitment stall, etc. Only with these supports can our development be stable and sustainable in our college.
* **Support of infrastructure:** As a technology-based student organization, we expect a form of infrastructural supports such as web server, or powerful workstation to support our development on the projects and some other researches.
* **Office:** If possible, we hope and appreciate that we could have an office in our campus to conduct our activities. It would be even better to have a meeting room with screen/projector and white board.

We sincerely hope that the college administrations and Innovation Center can take our ideas and our plan into consideration, and make the UIC HCC able to blossom in UIC.
