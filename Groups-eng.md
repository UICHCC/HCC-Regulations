# UIC HCC Computer Society Groups Plan

UIC HCC Computer Society (Association) (UICHCC or HCC in short) is (currently) a non-student-association interest-driven organization. Its mode of operation is similar to [TEDxUIC](https://tedxuic.com/); that is, the association's internal members are responsible for maintaining the operation of the association and participating in project development, however **all the creative production of UICHCC will be opened to the public**.

The association is organized as (a relatively losen form like) star topology, that is, setting up a central group (Core Group), while project groups (unlimited in number), which are managed by the central group, are set under it. Unlike the concept of "department", these groups can be added, or revoked, not even affecting the association's normal work. Members of a specific group are not restricted to that group; that is, groups are used only for management and publicity, **everyone can, at their will, participate in all project groups in the association (except: the group has extra regulations, the infrastructures and services maintained by the association).**
  - Practically, under the Core Group, there are several groups which are maintaining the association itself; although these groups are at the same level of other project groups, revoking or changing these groups needs to be unanimously adopted by the Core Group. See also the regulations on operation of the Core Group.
