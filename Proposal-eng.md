# Proposal - UIC HCC Computer Society

Dear Sir / Madam:



We are computer technology enthusiasts in UIC from different majors and different grades, who founded UIC HCC Computer Society (Unofficial) in October, 2016, in hope of spreading the knowledge of computer science and technology, conveying the sprit of open source, and sharing as well as focusing on the frontier development of computer science. Today, we hope to establish UIC HCC Computer Society officially attaching to Innovation Center, which will be put in services soon since the UIC new campus have been moved smoothly. We hope to make contributions to students and staffs in UIC as well as the Industry-University-Research Integration plan of UIC with the support of this platform.

This proposal will introduce the overview, vision, missions, tasks and expected achievements of UIC HCC Computer Society (hereafter abbreviated as the Society). Simutaneously, we will list our expectations to Innovation Center and UIC.



## Overview of the Society

The Society is established unofficially in October, 2016, and have 20 members from different majors and different grades (members list in appendix). We make our goal **Bridging You And Technology** as our responsibility, and spread knowledge related to computer science to UIC teachers and students in different occasions actively. With the emerge of new technologies in computer science, we find it difficult to achieve our goal and keep our development under the unofficial operation mode. Therefore, the Society wish to obtain the strong support from UIC and Innovation Center to carry out carry out more science-popularising lectures, practices, and research activities.

Currently, we have our public website, GitHub Organization, mail system and WeChat official account.



## Vision of the Society

In order to implement a fulfilling practice on the fundamental goal of the Society, **Bridging You And Technology**, the Society hopes to carry out **popularization of knowledge related to computer science**, **software and hardware development** cooperated with our school or the Society organizations, **participation in open source projects** and **research on frontier theories of computer science and their application**.

### Popularizing knowledge related to computer science

Though computer has gone into our life, for most people, computer is still a "black-box". Meanwhile, many concepts of computer science such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are very popular. New products and concepts in computer science field emerge one after the other. Many people are interested in these "high technology" products and concepts.

Most of the members in the Society have some experience and knowledge on computer science, and they are eager to share their own knowledge and experience to others. We refer the operation mode of CUHK(SZ) _Computer @ Comity_ and make popularization of computer science knowledge as our long term goal as well as a service and welfare provided for all of UIC teachers and students.

The scope of popularize includes but not limited to daily usage of computer, skills of using UIC IT system, introduction of programming languages, introduction to data analysis and introduction of Artificial Intelligence. The form of these activities includes but not limited to offline lectures, workshop, sharing discussion, WeChat official account push and online interactive learning.

We hope to respond to our mission through popularize of computer science knowledge, and promote the popularization of knowledge related to IT and computer in UIC to let listeners know more about current trend of computer science and IT industry. At the same time, we can broad the scope of both sides of sharing by these activities.

### Cooperation on software and hardware development

We have found that many people have great ideas. However, they don't know how to achieve their idea. When an idea stopped at the stage of an "idea", then it is impossible to show its value. The Society hope to achieve the ideas of UIC with the help of incubation mechanism of Innovation Center.

We hope that we can build a bridge connecting ideas and achievement with the frame of Innovation Center.  We will accept ideas from inside and outside the Society, build up a mechanism to evaluate, and work on some projects according to our evaluation.

Moreover, we hope to seize this opportunity to cooperate with other companies and organizations outside school. I believe we can connect with the IT industry in these cooperation to promote our ability and popularize newest trend of IT industry.

### Participation of open source projects

We are in a world of open source, and we rely on open source software every day. The spirit and the value of open source are influencing the whole IT industry. We are responsible to make contributions to open source communities. These includes but not limited to localization (translation) of software, code submission, and creation of open source software. We expect that our participation can push on the popularization and development of open source culture in UIC, and in addition, pushing on the spread of value of sharing in UIC.

### Research on frontier theories of computer science and their application

Computer Science and IT industry is always under fast development. It is necessary for us to follow the cutting edge of academic and industry of IT. The reason why we do it is because we can make some contributions on scientific research of UIC and provide resources for knowledge popularization.

We hope to cooperate with UIC Innovation Center and divisions, majors in UIC, and let our members participate in research projects conducted by  Innovation Center and other organizations. The topic and content of the research should not have any limitation either.

## Our expectations

The above content of this proposal is all we expect to do in the near future. To achieve these goals in UIC, support from our school and Innovation Center is indispensable. Therefore, we hope to obtain the following support from school and Innovation Center (Sort by importance):

* **Identity of student organization:** We are still an unofficial student organization until now. To arrange activities in our school, an official identity is necessary. We hope to obtain an official student organization which can be admitted.
* **Support of administrative:** If we can obtain an official student organization identity, we hope to obtain corresponding support on administrative, including reasonable budget on activities, a channel to promote our activities, recruitment stall, etc. Only with these support can we be stable and develop in our school.
* **Support of infrastructure:** As a technology-based student organization, we expect a form of infrastructure support such as web server, powerful workstation to support our development on projects and some other research.
* **Office:** If possible, we hope that we could have an office in our school to conduct our activity. It would be even better to have a meeting room with small television and white board.

We sincerely hope that our school and Innovation Center can take our idea and our plan into consideration, and make our plan blossom in UIC.
